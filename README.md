# Color Flipper

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Description

**Color Flipper** is a minimalist web application that generates random hex colors on demand. Every time you click the **Flip** button, the app picks a new color by randomly combining characters from the hexadecimal alphabet (`0–9`, `A–F`) to form a 6-character hex code. The generated color is instantly applied as the full-page background, giving you an immediate and immersive visual preview. At the same time, the hex value (e.g. `#A3F5C1`) is displayed on screen and its own text color is updated to match, creating a self-referential color label that stays legible against any background.

The use case is straightforward: designers, developers, or anyone working with color can use Color Flipper as a quick inspiration tool to discover color combinations, test how a hue looks at full saturation across the entire viewport, or simply grab a hex code to paste into a stylesheet, design file, or color picker. There are no inputs to fill out, no palettes to configure, and no extra steps — one click is all it takes.

## Getting Started

With the stack and dependencies in mind, you can spin up the app locally in a few steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Ensure you are on **Node 22** (an `.nvmrc` is provided — run `nvm use` if you use nvm)
4. Execute: `npm install`
5. Execute: `npm run dev`

The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

Once the app is running, you can verify its behavior with the test suite:

1. Navigate to the project folder
2. Execute: `npm test`

For coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## CI

Every push and pull request to `main` runs the GitHub Actions pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It executes three sequential jobs: **lint & type-check**, **tests**, and **build**. A PR cannot be merged if any job fails.

## Security Audit

Beyond functional testing, it is also worth auditing the dependency tree for known vulnerabilities.

### npm audit

Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies:

```bash
npm audit
```

## Known Issues

None at the moment.
